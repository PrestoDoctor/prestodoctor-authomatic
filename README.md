# prestodoctor-authomatic

An example of [PrestoDoctor](http://prestodoctor.com/) OAuth integration for your website using Python 3.x and [Authomatic](https://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic/). The example is not fully functional, only guidelining, so you need to use your brain to figure out the hard parts.

Internal user data mappings provided for Websauna framework. The framework itself is not yet released as writing of this.

Example integration test cases provided using [pytest-splinter](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-splinter/), [py.test](http://pytest.org/) and [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/).
